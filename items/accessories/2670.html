      Just a Note: 
     <br>
      This Ring is not harmful like Ring Worm, since it will not reduce your trained Stats, only reduce LUK/CHA from equipment (Blue number) until '0'. 
     <br>
      It can't lower your stats to less than 0. 
     <br>
      And it is a Junk-like item from its high sell-back.
