    <li>Weapon is animated; the runic circle rotates continuously. <br></li>
    <li>Weapon is color-custom; the handle is linked to the player's base color; description erroneously states the weapon is also linked to the player's trim color. <br></li>
    <li>Weapon's appearance is attuned to the player's equipped weapon's element; refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DF-Pedia/DF-Pedia/raw/master/weapons/TheSpellsword'sLegacy-ElementalAttunement.png">this chart</a> for all appearances. <br></li>
    <li>Click anywhere on the weapon to change its orientation between facing backwards or forwards. <br><br><img src="https://github.com/DF-Pedia/DF-Pedia/raw/master/weapons/TheSpellsword'sLegacy.png" align="middle" border="0" alt=""> <br><br><i>Thanks to Jay for image and elemental attunement image.</i><font color="#eeeeee"> <span class="info"> <br><br>
